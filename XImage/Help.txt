XImage (Extensible Image) is an open technology for real-time image manipulation over HTTP.  It defines a standard 
interface for performing common image operations such as resizing, cropping, compressing, filtering, etc.  
In addition, it describes how to add extended functionality that might be custom for your use case in a manner 
that is discoverable and reusable.  

The X image operates at the server level it can be made to operate at application level if desired
Developing for multiple 
The goal of the XImage interface is to simplify the development of of apps
that span across devices with a wide range of screen depths and sizes and varyingly 
Many advanced frameworks are needing a standard way to request images with particular attributes 

QUERY STRING
------------
To maximize CDN and browser cache hit ratios, the following arguments are designed to have a strict set of rules.  
Therefore, capitalization and parameter order are important and superfluous parameters will be treated as errors. 

  help       Shows this help screen.  Each implementaion of XImage must show this help screen which is primarily 
             used to show which features it supports.  
  w          Width of the image.  If h is not supplied, it will be inferred proportionally.
             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=100"">{0}?w=100</a>
  h          Height of the image.  If w is not supplied, it will be inferred proportionally.
             e.g. <a href=""{0}?h=100"">{0}?h=100</a>
  !          Allow upscaling.  By default, the image will not be resized larger than it's original dimensions.
             To override this, append '!' to the end of the width or height.
             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=1000!&h=1000!"">{0}?w=1000!&h=1000!</a>
  c          Cropping mode.  This is only valid when both w and h are specified.  Available options are:
                (none)       Don't actually supply 'none', just leave it off.  No parts of the image will be cropped.
                             It will be resized proportionally until it fits completely within the w x h boundaries.
                             This will likely result in either width or height being smaller than the requested value.
                             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&h=200"">{0}?w=200&h=200</a>
                fill         The image will be resized proportionally until it completely fills the w x h boundares.
                             This will likely result in cropping off either top/bottom edges or left/right edges
                             but the resulting dimensions will be exactly w x h.
                             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&h=100&c=fill"">{0}?w=200&h=100&c=fill</a>
                stretch      Each edge will be resized disproportionally until it reaches its w x h boundaries.
                             Results are exactly w x h and no edges are cropped but the image will appear distorted.
                             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&h=100&c=stretch"">{0}?w=200&h=100&c=stretch</a>
                (color)      It will be resized proportionally until it fits completely within the w x h boundaries.
                             This will likely result in void space on the left/right or top/bottom which will be 
                             filled with the supplied color.  Must be a 6 or 8 digit lower case hex, don't use #.
                             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&h=100&c=3b5999"">{0}?w=200&h=100&c=3b5999</a>

  m          Mask.  Certain shapes can be applied making the outside either transparent or the background color.
                circle       Applies a circle-shaped mask in the center with a diameter of the shortest edge.
                             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&m=circle"">{0}?w=200&m=circle</a>
  f          Filter.
  q          Quality of the image.  Values, as percentages, must be an integer between 1 - 100.  
             Alternatively, you can specify a max content size (in kilobytes) by appending 'kb', e.g. q=150kb.
             However some file sizes are impossibly small for some formats which will result in a best effort size.
             e.g. <a href=""{0}?q=5"">{0}?q=5</a> or  <a href=""{0}?q=5kb"">{0}?q=5kb</a>
  o          Output format of the image.  Supported values are jpg, gif, png.
             e.g. <a href=""{0}?w=200&f=gif"">{0}?w=200&f=gif</a>

RESPONSE HEADERS
----------------
XImage uses reponse headers to specify suported capabilities and also to communicate meta data about the image.
The meta data, in paticular, can become useful with a HEAD request especially when used in conjuction with a CDN for 
fast, single-digit millisecond response times carrying rich details about that image.
