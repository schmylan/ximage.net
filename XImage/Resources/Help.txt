XImage (Extensible Image) is an open technology for real-time image manipulation over HTTP.  It defines a standard 
interface for performing common image operations such as resizing, cropping, compressing, filtering, etc.  
In addition, it describes how to add extended functionality that might be custom for your use case in a manner 
that is discoverable and reusable.  

QUERY STRING
------------
  help        Shows this help screen.  Each implementation of XImage must show this help screen which is primarily 
              used to show which features it supports.  
  width (w)   Width of the image.  If h is not supplied, it will be inferred proportionally.
              By default, it will not be resized larger than its original dimensions.  To override , append '!'.
              e.g. <a href="{0}?w=100">{0}?w=100</a> or <a href="{0}?w=1000!">{0}?w=1000!</a>
  height (h)  Height of the image.  If w is not supplied, it will be inferred proportionally.
              By default, it will not be resized larger than its original dimensions.  To override , append '!'.
              e.g. <a href="{0}?h=100">{0}?h=100</a> or <a href="{0}?h=1000!">{0}?h=1000!</a>
  crop (c)    Crop will help you control the output dimensions and resizing/zooming approach.
                 (none)         By default.  No parts of the image will be cropped. It will be resized proportionally 
                                until it fits completely within the w x h boundaries.  This will likely result in 
                                either width or height being smaller than the requested value.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?w=200&h=200">{0}?w=200&h=200</a>
                 zoom(c)        The image will be resized proportionally.  To ensure the dimensions are exactly w x h,
                                padding will be applied to the top/bottom or left/right unless you include '!' at the end,
                                which indicates that clipping the top/bottom or left/right should be used instead.
                                Optionally supply a color to use as the padding color.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?w=400&h=100&c=zoom">{0}?w=400&h=100&c=zoom</a> or <a href="{0}?w=400&h=100&c=zoom!">{0}?w=400&h=100&c=zoom!</a>
                 stretch        Each edge will be resized disproportionally until it reaches its w x h boundaries.
                                Results are exactly w x h and no edges are cropped but the image will appear distorted.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?w=200&h=100&c=stretch">{0}?w=200&h=100&c=stretch</a>
                 whitespace(p)  If there is whitespace surrounding the image (like a basketball on a white background) 
                                this will crop it out.  To ensure the dimensions are exactly w x h,
                                padding will be applied to the top/bottom or left/right unless you include '!' at the end,
                                which indicates that clipping the top/bottom or left/right should be used instead.
                                Control the amount of padding used with the (p) arg.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?c=whitespace">{0}?c=whitespace</a> or <a href="{0}?w=200&h=200&c=whitespace!">{0}?w=200&h=200&c=whitespace!</a>
  filter (f)  This list is loosely based on CSS3 filters.
                 grayscale(a)   Desaturates the image on a scale of 0 - 1.  The arg (a) is optional.  Default is 1.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?f=grayscale">{0}?f=grayscale</a>
                 invert         Inverts the image.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?f=invert">{0}?f=invert</a>
  mask (m)    Certain shapes can be applied making the outside either transparent or the background color.
                 circle         Applies a circle-shaped mask in the center with a diameter of the shortest edge.
                                If your image is not square, feel free to use the fill crop to elimiate uwanted padding.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?w=200&h=200&c=fill&m=circle&o=png">{0}?w=200&h=200&c=fill&m=circle&o=png</a>
                 roundrect(n)   Rounds the corners with a radius of n.  
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?w=200&m=roundrect(20)&o=png">{0}?w=200&m=roundrect(20)&o=png</a>
  output (o)  Output format of the image.
                 jpg(q)         Jpeg format.  The quality (q) is optional.  Values, as percentages, must be an integer 
                                between 1 - 100.  Alternatively, you can specify a max content size (in kilobytes) 
                                by appending 'kb'.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?o=jpg(5)">{0}?o=jpg(5)</a> or <a href="{0}?o=jpg(15kb)">{0}?o=jpg(15kb)</a>
                 gif            GIF format.  (Doesn't yet support transparency or palette size.  Coming soon.)
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?o=gif">{0}?o=gif</a>
                 png            PNG format.  Supports transparency, go nuts with various 'mask' options above.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?o=png">{0}?o=png</a>
                 json           JSON format.  This makes it easier for some clients to read the meta properties.
                                e.g. <a href="{0}?o=json">{0}?o=json</a>

RESPONSE HEADERS
----------------
XImage uses response headers to specify supported capabilities and also to communicate meta data about the image.
The meta data, in particular, can become useful with a HEAD request especially when used in conjunction with a CDN for 
fast, single-digit millisecond response times carrying rich details about that image.
